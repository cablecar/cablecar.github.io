While working with us on microplace.com project, Michael provided solid deliverables and valuable advice at all stages of the process and on a wide range of technical topics.

Michael and I worked together for a brief period, while he was helping us get MicroPlace off the ground. I was impressed with his knowledge of Ruby on Rails and software development in general, and learned loads from him. Michael is one of those rare people who are software geniuses and at the same time are fantastic with people. I would recommend Michael to any team that needs an expert-level engineer, but don't want to deal with the usual oversized ego that's associated with gurus.                        </blockquote>

                        <blockquote>
I brought Cable Car (Michael only) into DogTime.com to help us with some challenges in Ruby on Rails. We took advantage of his relatively long Rails 
experience and threw our most thorny issues at him, specifically asking him to work out Rails-internal quirks to spare our staff 
from stuff we didn't really need to master. He dug in quickly and thoroughly, and he was a pleasure to work with as he explained 
where the problems lay and we co-brainstormed our way out. Michael was definitely a great boon to our work.                        </blockquote>

                        <blockquote>
                          Michael has one of the most rare combinations: deep technical expertise and practical business judgment. Michael was very quickly able to use his technical skills to develop a sound technical architecture for our project. I was very impressed with his CTO-level skills and further impressed when, without hesitation, was willing to get down into the details to make sure that the developer was following best practices, especially with regard to documentation. There is no question that Michael is technically gifted. However, what I most admire is that Michael is able to couple these technical skills with practical business judgment. Too many technologists want to build and build and build disregarding the actual business needs and associated cost. Michael is very keenly aware of incorporating cost/benefit and was able to talk through the alternatives along the spectrum of technological sophistication. I feel very comfortable in saying that Michael played a critical role in the success of our project. Thank you Michael. I whole-heartedly recommend Michael and will definitely continue to look to Michael as a key advisor and practitioner for our business.
